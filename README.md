## Basics of Data Structures
### Introduction

What is a data structure?

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently. It defines the relationship and operations that can be performed on the data, providing a means to access and manipulate it in a structured and organized manner. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
